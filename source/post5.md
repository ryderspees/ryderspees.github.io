# EECS 201

In the halls of U of M,  
There's a class that's known to all.  
With circuits, code, and math aplenty,  
It's EECS 201, standing tall.  

From Boolean algebra to transistor gates,  
The fundamentals we learn with care.  
To build upon with each passing week,  
Our knowledge and skills we'll share.  

Lab sessions filled with soldering irons,  
And debugging through the night.  
With each problem solved and challenge met,  
We'll emerge with newfound might.  

And as the semester comes to a close,  
We'll look back on all we've done.  
With gratitude for the professors and TAs,  
For helping us rise to the challenge, one by one.  

So here's to EECS 201,  
A class that's tough but fair.  
For every student who takes it on,  
A bright future is surely there.
