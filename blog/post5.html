<p>In the halls of U of M,<br />
There’s a class that’s known to all.<br />
With circuits, code, and math aplenty,<br />
It’s EECS 201, standing tall.</p>
<p>From Boolean algebra to transistor gates,<br />
The fundamentals we learn with care.<br />
To build upon with each passing week,<br />
Our knowledge and skills we’ll share.</p>
<p>Lab sessions filled with soldering irons,<br />
And debugging through the night.<br />
With each problem solved and challenge met,<br />
We’ll emerge with newfound might.</p>
<p>And as the semester comes to a close,<br />
We’ll look back on all we’ve done.<br />
With gratitude for the professors and TAs,<br />
For helping us rise to the challenge, one by one.</p>
<p>So here’s to EECS 201,<br />
A class that’s tough but fair.<br />
For every student who takes it on,<br />
A bright future is surely there.</p>
